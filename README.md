## Shift Cipher

One of the simplest types of encryption is the Shift Cipher. It provides a good introduction to encryption because it is easy to understand.

The Shift Cipher is also called the "Caesar Cipher", because Julius Caesar liked to use it for his personal correspondence. A shift cipher takes the text of the a message and shifts all the letters to to the left or right. For example, if a message was shifted by two, then A would become C, B would become D, C would become E, and so on.

The most popular shift cipher is ROT13 ("ROT" = "rotates"). It shifts letters 13 positions. It is popular because 13 is half of the 26 letter alphabet, which gives it a unique property. The same function can be used to both encrypt and decrypt.

PHP has a built in functio for ROT13 called `str_rot13()`.
